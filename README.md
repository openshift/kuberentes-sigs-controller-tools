# Kubernetes controller-tools Project

The Kubernetes controller-tools Project is a set of go libraries for building Controllers.

## Development

Clone this project, and iterate on changes by running `./test.sh`.

This project uses Go modules to manage its dependencies, so feel free to work from outside
of your `GOPATH`. However, if you'd like to continue to work from within your `GOPATH`, please
export `GO111MODULE=on`.

## Releasing and Versioning

See [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md).

## Compatibility

Every minor version of controller-tools (CT) has been tested with a specific minor version of client-go. A controller-tools minor version *may* be compatible with
other client-go minor versions, but this is by chance and neither supported nor tested. In general, we create one minor version of controller-tools
for each minor version of client-go and other k8s.io/* dependencies.

The minimum Go version of controller-tools is the highest minimum Go version of our Go dependencies. Usually, this will
be identical to the minimum Go version of the corresponding k8s.io/* dependencies.

Compatible k8s.io/*, client-go and minimum Go versions can be looked up in our [go.mod](go.mod) file.

|          | k8s.io/*, client-go | minimum Go version |
|----------|:-------------------:|:------------------:|
| CT v0.17 |        v0.32        |        1.23        |
| CT v0.16 |        v0.31        |        1.22        |
| CT v0.15 |        v0.30        |        1.22        |
| CT v0.14 |        v0.29        |        1.20        |
| CT v0.13 |        v0.28        |        1.20        |
| CT v0.12 |        v0.27        |        1.20        |
